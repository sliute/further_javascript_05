Also take a look at my contributions to versions [1](https://github.com/sliute/further_javascript) [2](https://github.com/MicaW/further_javascript), [3](https://github.com/edytawrobel/ToDoListJS) and [4](https://github.com/tamarlehmann/FurtherJS-Notes) in the respective MA student repos.

## How to Use
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sliute/further_javascript_05.git

When opening SpecRunner.html, also open Chrome's developer console to see test descriptions and results.
